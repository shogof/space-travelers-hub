## Getting Started

To set up the Space Travelers Hub on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sja-thedude/Space-Travelers-Hub.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Space-Travelers-Hub
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The application will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

5. **Resolve Issues**:
   If you encounter issues related to eslint or webpack, run:

     npx stylelint "**/*.{css,scss}"
     ```
   - **JavaScript Linter**:
     ```bash
     npx eslint .
     ```

## Deployment

To prepare the application for production deployment:

1. **Build the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This command generates an optimized production build in the `build` directory.

2. **Eject Configuration (Optional)**:
   ```bash
   npm run eject
   ```
   Use this command to expose configuration files for advanced customization. This action is irreversible.
